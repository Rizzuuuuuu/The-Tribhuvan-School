  <h2>"Learning gives creativity, creativity leads to thinking, Thinking provides knowledge, knowledge makes you great."</h2>
  <p style="color:magenta"><i><b><br><br>APJ Abdul Kalam Learning is a lifelong experience and here at The Tribhuvan School, we aim to develop children as lifelong learners. Keeping our school motto in mind ‘Let Wisdom Prevail’, we emphasize upon holistic development of a child by fostering a blend of scholastic and co-scholastic activities. Wisdom is not just about mugging up books but rather it’s a mix of experience, knowledge, and good judgement. Academics is important, but practical intelligence helps one to cope with daily challenges in life. We value the individuality of each student, while hone and foster this talent believing each student is unique. If we help the children to discover their inner self, every dream would become a reality and all fears conquerable. With our broad curriculum spectrum coupled with individual attention to the potential of each student, we expect our students to gain academic excellence of national benchmark. The infrastructure of the school that matches with the best of the institutions is being constantly upgraded to make schooling a fun filled experience. Despite being a relatively new school in the state, I feel proud to congratulate the students for their glorious achievements through the years in different fields. The journey so far has been worthwhile; however, I believe there are many more milestones to cross. As teachers, what do we give to our students? We give them roots, a foundation to stay grounded yet flourish, giving them wings to take off to realize dreams in their flight. I believe that I can draw upon the collective efforts of all members of The Tribhuvan Family; a wonderful management, parents, teachers and the entire staff to share my optimism and partner with me in this growth.</b></i></p>
